          <p>
          This section should contain some files for prospective clients to see, files may include description of the products by the ISTS, but must only be limited to commercial products. Non-Commercials are included in the later sections. This section is divided into 2 sub-sections: Support and Downloads. In the support section, all the products developed/maintained by the ISTS can be listed. Also a description of the products ISTS is dealing with, can be included in the Downloads section, for e.g. User Manuals (optional). 
          This entire section is an extrapolation of the previous section, but must contain the names and a picture of the products ISTS is involved with. This gives a very clear picture to the clients to see and trust the brand. 
          </p>
