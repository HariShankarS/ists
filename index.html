         The recent era of Industrialization has revolutionized the art of trade, with a complete give-and-take process of Cross Border Flow of resources, both materialistic and human resources. Such rapid transfer of technology has stressed on improving the viability of domestic technology, which is possible only after extracting the required resources and applying an engineered thought. India leads the world's Agriculture sector, with Agro products being one of the most important of the country's resources. As with rapid Technology, comes also the challenge of Sustainability. Resources are to be utilized as such as their consumption is both optimal and the utility of the resource remains prolonged. Ideas like such has stressed the art of eco-friendliness. How we treat the environment is a direct function of what the environment gives us back.
